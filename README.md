## How the list got started

I had been learning Python for a few weeks when, in January, 2019, I stumbled upon [a Reddit post in r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/amyryp/what_would_you_suggest_a_person_new_to/) seeking suggestions on how to become a better programmer.

[One of the comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/amyryp/what_would_you_suggest_a_person_new_to/efps9cs/) asked for good books or websites about algorithms and data structures. I had collected links to useful Python learning resources among which the free ebook [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python](https://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html#problem-solving-with-algorithms-and-data-structures-using-python), so I [shared the link in a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/amyryp/what_would_you_suggest_a_person_new_to/efpvm1n/).

My comment got a couple dozen upvotes, which hinted at the interest in good, easily accessible Python books. Therefore I later put together a list of all the free Python books I had found and [posted it to r/Python](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/anfdyh/free_python_books/).

I was right. My post got hundreds of upvotes and several redditors contributed links to more books and lists, thus confirming the interest in such a resource. The next step was to make my list more useful and widely available by integrating it with the suggestions I got in the Reddit post, publishing it to GitHub, and expanding it with more books.

It's the list you're reading now.
